She paid as little notice to the instrument of this graffiti as she had when she purchased it. An unseen international presence in her home.",

She was actually looking for a present for her neice - a painting set maybe or a stenciling kit. In the end she settled on a scrap book, grabbing a couple of files for her utility bills and a box of standard pencils so she could mark up some sheet music. She paid, the cashier was sweet but a bit slow. Sarah had forgotten all about their conversation the moment she left the store.",

Box upon identical box was stacked on pallets and shelves from floor to ceiling, conveyer belts and fork-lifts moving in a steady, unchoreographed dance. “40,000 square meters son,” said Ron, Bobby’s new supervisor. “It’s easy to know where to go to pick out orders,” he continued. “The light flashes on, showing you where you need to go. Soon it’ll be even easier, we’ll have an automated voice directing you around.” Bobby looked at the portly man next to him. “Great,” he said. “I won’t have to think at all.”",

They’d have a little chat and then she’d go in and get changed, becoming part of the colourful factory-scape. Ana worked on graphite pencils, gluing the wooden bodies to the lead. Every now and then she’s find one that wasn’t quite done right, and take it home for her son João. Today was one of those days. The lead was clearly broken, so she glued it, let it set and put it in her overall pocket as the rest of the pencils slid along the conveyer to the next station.",

Hui wanted to be a geologist; working in the refinery seemed like a good idea. He spent his evenings learning about the graphite they extracted - how it formed in crystals in schist from rocks heated and melted by the Earth’s movements. He sometimes got pains in his chest, but that could be the cigarettes he’d been smoking. He liked to watch the graphite granules cascade into buckets, catching the light, and imagine them turning into diamonds.",

It had been a long shift. Just two more hours. Kuai shakes his beleaguered head to try to clear it as the last of the miners passed him. He looks to his left, down into the shaft.

He juxtaposed this growth with increasing food imports, and pointed out that this change was damaging and degrading the farmers’ standard of living. Flax, he argued, was implicated in the commercialisation of rural societies in Russia. The crop can be grown on very poor soil, though, so how much does it compete? Nowadays 75,000 hectares of Russian land is devoted to growing flax, which produces not only oil but also fibres for linen cloth. How does this fit with Russia’s aim to become agriculturally 80 per cent self-sufficient by 2020?",
